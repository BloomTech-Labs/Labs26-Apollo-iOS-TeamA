## Apollo Product README

Apollo is a software product tool used to help leadership guide the vision and delivery of the team.

## Description

Most software team management software focuses on task management instead of vision alignment. Apollo is focused on leading with vision, and supporting a team by unblocking them rather than by managing flow of tasks.

Apollo's MVP product is a basic survey tool - similar to Geekbot.

The survey asks the leader a series of questions, and then shares the response with the team and asks them to answer a new series of questions in response to the leader's post.

## Usage

This project was part of Lambda School's Labs curriculum, for the purpose of education and internship experience in iOS Development.
